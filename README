Hi There,

you probably want to have exuberant ctags in your path before you use this.

This is the vim setup I use on my machines.  I generally set it up by:

1)  Install real vim (apt-get install vim-addon-manager) should get it all.
2)  git clone this repo to ~/Projects or whatever.
3)  ln -s $prefix/vim/.vim ~/
4)  ln -s $prefix/vim/.vimrc ~/

This has a few tasty plugins with modifications for how I work.  NO
guarantees this will make you faster, but it makes me considerably
faster at slinging C.

Check out the glib snippets.  They are where the magic happens.
